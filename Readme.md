# csv2osdi

csv2osdi is a command-line utility to upload a CSV file of people into an [OSDI](http://opensupporter.org) compliant system.  It features the ability to assign tags on a per row basis and has a configurable schema for csv files.

It can also verify that the remote system has the necessary tags before the upload. (Some systems require them to be created in advance)

For systems that do not natively support phone numbers, csv2osdi can be configured to map them to custom fields on the remote system.

> Action Network requires this

## Compliance

csv2osdi requires a working AEP and osdi:person_signup_helper to operate.

## Install and Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Run '''bundle install'''
3. Copy config-sample.yml to config.yml
4. Edit config to your liking

> If you are on Windows, run bundle exec ruby csv2osdi.rb

> csv2osdi comes with a sample CSV and config-sample to test with.
